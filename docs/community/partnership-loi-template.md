## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use LOI vs Other Documents

| Document | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| LOI | Formal partnership intent, grant applications |
| MOU | Similar to LOI, more detailed |
| Partnership Agreement | Binding legal contract |
| Integration Agreement | Technical/legal binding |

### LOI Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: LOI should be 1-2 pages max
2. **Be specific**: Include concrete deliverables
3. **Set timeline**: Even if tentative
4. **Non-binding**: Clear that it's not a contract
5. **Both sides sign**: Shows mutual commitment

### Customization

Customize the template for each partner:
- **Wallets**: Focus on stealth address UX
- **DEXs**: Emphasize trading privacy
- **DAOs**: Highlight viewing keys for treasuries
- **Payment apps**: Stress any-amount transfers

### Red Flags

Don't sign LOI if:
- Partner wants exclusive rights
- Unrealistic timelines demanded
- Partner won't commit any resources
- No clear point of contact
- Mismatch in expectations
