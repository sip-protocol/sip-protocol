## Outreach Templates

### Initial Outreach (Cold)

```
Subject: Privacy Integration for [Project Name]

Hi [Name],

I'm [Name] from SIP Protocol. We're building the privacy layer for Solana—
stealth addresses, hidden amounts, and viewing keys for compliance.

I noticed [Project] handles [specific use case] and thought our SDK could
add privacy as a feature for your users.

Quick value props:
- One-line integration (npm install @sip-protocol/sdk)
- Any amount, any SPL token
- Optional viewing keys for compliance/audits

Would you be open to a 15-min call to explore if this fits [Project]?

Here's a quick demo: [link]

Best,
