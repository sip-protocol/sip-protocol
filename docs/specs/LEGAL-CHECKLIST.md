## 1. Securities Law Analysis (USA)

### 1.1 Howey Test Assessment

The Howey Test determines if an instrument is a "security" under US law.

| Prong | Question | SIP Analysis | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Investment of Money** | Did purchasers invest money or value? | Yes — tokens acquired via purchase/contribution | Present |
| **Common Enterprise** | Is there horizontal or vertical commonality? | Partial — decentralized protocol, no single enterprise | Medium |
| **Expectation of Profits** | Do purchasers expect profits? | Mitigated — utility-first messaging, no profit promises | Low |
| **Efforts of Others** | Are profits derived from promoter efforts? | Mitigated — progressive decentralization, utility focus | Low |

### 1.2 Utility Token Characteristics

**Checklist — Document these characteristics:**

- [ ] Token provides genuine utility (governance voting, fee discounts)
- [ ] Token is functional at launch (not promise of future utility)
- [ ] Primary purpose is consumption, not investment
- [ ] Marketing emphasizes utility, not appreciation
- [ ] No guaranteed returns or profit sharing
- [ ] Value tied to network usage, not team efforts
- [ ] Decentralized governance reduces reliance on promoters

### 1.3 Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Investment expectation | Utility-first messaging, no APY promises |
| Common enterprise | Progressive decentralization, DAO structure |
| Reliance on others | Community governance, open-source code |
| Marketing claims | Legal review of all public communications |
