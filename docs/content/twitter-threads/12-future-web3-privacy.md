# Thread 12: The Future of Web3 Privacy

**Hook:** In 5 years, will blockchain transactions be private by default? Here's what's coming.

**1/**
In 5 years, will blockchain transactions be private by default?

Like HTTPS became default for the web?

Here's what the future of Web3 privacy looks like 🧵

**2/**
Where we are today:

- Privacy is opt-in
- Most tools are mixer-based
- Compliance is an afterthought
- Cross-chain privacy barely exists

Basically: 1995 web security levels.

**3/**
Where we're going:

- Privacy by default
- Cryptographic (not mixing)
- Compliance built-in
- Cross-chain seamless

Basically: Modern HTTPS levels.

**4/**
Prediction 1: Privacy becomes a wallet feature

Every major wallet will have:
- Private receive address
- Private send option
- Viewing key export

Not a separate app. Built into Phantom, MetaMask, etc.

**5/**
Prediction 2: Stealth addresses become standard

Like how HTTPS became default:
- 2010: "HTTPS is optional"
- 2015: "HTTPS recommended"
- 2020: "HTTPS required"

Stealth addresses will follow the same path.

**6/**
Prediction 3: Viewing keys replace full transparency

Institutions won't accept:
- Fully public (competitors see everything)
- Fully private (can't prove compliance)

They WILL accept: Private + auditable.

**7/**
Prediction 4: Proof composition unlocks new use cases

Combine proofs from multiple chains:
- Prove you hold NFT on Ethereum
- While paying on Solana
- Without revealing which NFT

Cross-chain identity without exposure.

**8/**
Prediction 5: Privacy middleware becomes infrastructure

Like CDNs for content delivery.

dApps won't build their own privacy.
They'll call a privacy API.
SIP or similar.

**9/**
Prediction 6: Regulatory clarity enables adoption

Currently: Regulations unclear, tools get banned

Future: Clear rules for compliant privacy
- KYC at on-ramps
- Privacy in between
- Disclosure when legally required

**10/**
Prediction 7: ZK becomes commoditized

Currently: ZK proofs are slow and expensive

Future: Hardware acceleration, faster circuits
- Proving on phones
- Real-time verification
- Privacy without waiting

**11/**
What SIP is building toward:

Phase 4 (2026): Same-chain privacy (Solana, Ethereum)
Phase 5 (2026-27): Proof composition, multi-chain
Standard proposal: SIP-EIP for industry adoption

**12/**
The three waves:

Wave 1 (now): Privacy tools (mixers, stealth)
Wave 2 (2026): Privacy infrastructure (SDK, middleware)
Wave 3 (2027+): Privacy standard (built into chains)

We're transitioning from Wave 1 to Wave 2.

**13/**
What won't change:

- Privacy will always have trade-offs
- Some users will want full anonymity
- Some users will want full transparency
- Most will want something in between

Flexibility matters.

**14/**
The future is private transactions being normal.

Not suspicious. Not special. Just... default.

We're building that future.
