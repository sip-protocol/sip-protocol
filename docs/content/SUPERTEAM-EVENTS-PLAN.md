Strategy for presenting SIP Protocol at 3 Superteam ecosystem events.

## Target Events

### Event 1: Superteam Demo Day (Priority)

**Goal:** Live SDK demo showing privacy integration
**Format:** 5-10 minute presentation + live coding

**Demo Script:**
1. "What if every crypto payment was as private as cash?"
2. Live code: Add privacy to wallet in 5 lines
3. Send private payment on devnet
4. Show transaction on explorer (hidden amounts)
5. CTA: "Try it yourself - docs.sip-protocol.org"

**Materials:**
- [x] Workshop slides (docs/workshops/slides.md)
- [x] Quick-start guides (docs/guides/)
- [ ] Demo app for live presentation
- [ ] Backup video in case of network issues

## Event Application Template

Subject: SIP Protocol Demo for [Event Name]

Hi [Organizer],

I'd love to demo SIP Protocol at [Event Name]. SIP adds privacy to Solana dApps with one SDK - hidden senders, amounts, and recipients, with viewing keys for compliance.

Demo: Live code adding privacy to a wallet (5 min)
Audience: Developers building wallets, DEXs, payments
Value: Practical tool they can integrate immediately

Happy to do full workshop or quick demo, whatever fits the agenda.

Best,
[Name]
SIP Protocol | sip-protocol.org
