### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

# Industry Leaders Launch Privacy Standards Working Group

**Cross-Chain Privacy Standard Initiative Unites Leading Blockchain Projects**

**[CITY, DATE]** — A coalition of leading blockchain organizations today announced the formation of the Privacy Standards Working Group (PSWG), an open industry body dedicated to developing interoperable privacy standards for the blockchain ecosystem.

The Working Group brings together [NUMBER] founding members spanning privacy protocols, wallets, decentralized exchanges, blockchain foundations, and compliance providers. The coalition aims to establish unified standards that enable privacy by default while maintaining regulatory compliance capabilities.

"Privacy is becoming table stakes for blockchain adoption," said [QUOTE ATTRIBUTION]. "The Privacy Standards Working Group ensures the industry builds interoperable solutions rather than fragmented approaches that burden developers and users."

### Founding Members

The Working Group launches with the following founding members:

**Privacy Protocols:**
- [Member 1]
- [Member 2]

**Wallets:**
- [Member 3]
- [Member 4]

**Decentralized Exchanges:**
- [Member 5]
- [Member 6]

**Blockchain Foundations:**
- [Member 7]
- [Member 8]

**Compliance Providers:**
- [Member 9]
- [Member 10]

### Initial Focus

The Working Group will initially focus on:

1. **Stealth Address Standards** — Unified format for private recipient addresses across chains
2. **Viewing Key Protocols** — Standards for selective disclosure and regulatory compliance
3. **Cross-Chain Privacy** — Interoperable privacy for bridge and multi-chain transactions
4. **Compliance Integration** — Frameworks for sanctions screening and audit trails

### Shielded Intents Protocol (SIP)

The Working Group builds on the Shielded Intents Protocol (SIP), an open privacy standard that enables:

- **Stealth Addresses:** One-time recipient addresses for transaction privacy
- **Pedersen Commitments:** Cryptographic hiding of transaction amounts
- **Viewing Keys:** Selective disclosure for compliance and auditing
- **Cross-Chain Support:** Privacy across 15+ blockchain networks

Unlike mixing services, SIP is designed for regulatory compliance with built-in disclosure mechanisms.

### Join the Working Group

Organizations interested in participating can apply at [WEBSITE].

**Full Member Benefits:**

Announcing the Privacy Standards Working Group

[NUMBER] leading blockchain organizations have united to build interoperable privacy standards.

Founding members include:
• @[Member1]
• @[Member2]
• @[Member3]
• + [X] more

🧵 Here's what we're building:

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Privacy in blockchain is fragmented.

Every chain, every wallet, every DEX builds their own approach.

This creates:
❌ Integration burden for developers
❌ Inconsistent UX for users
❌ Confusion for regulators

We're fixing this with open standards.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
What we're standardizing:

1️⃣ Stealth Addresses
   One-time recipient addresses across all chains

2️⃣ Viewing Keys
   Selective disclosure for compliance

3️⃣ Cross-Chain Privacy
   Private transactions across bridges

4️⃣ Compliance Frameworks
   Audit trails that work
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
This is NOT another mixer.

SIP (Shielded Intents Protocol) is privacy WITH compliance:

✅ Private by default
✅ Disclosed when required
✅ Full audit capability
✅ Sanctions screening supported

Privacy that institutions can actually use.
```

The Working Group is open to all.

Full Members: Voting rights, early access, subgroup participation

## FAQ for Media

**Q: How is this different from Tornado Cash?**
A: Tornado Cash was a mixer that permanently broke transaction links. SIP and the Working Group focus on privacy with built-in compliance—transactions can be disclosed to authorized parties via viewing keys. It's privacy with accountability, not anonymity.

**Q: Why do we need standards for privacy?**
A: Currently, every project builds privacy differently. This creates integration burden, inconsistent user experience, and regulatory confusion. Standards enable interoperability and give regulators a framework to reference.

**Q: Who controls the Working Group?**
A: The Working Group is governed by its member organizations through a Steering Committee elected by the full membership. No single organization controls it.

**Q: Are the standards open source?**
A: Yes. All specifications are CC0 (public domain), reference implementations are MIT licensed, and governance is transparent.

**Q: How can my organization join?**
A: Apply for membership at [WEBSITE]. Full members have voting rights; observer membership is open to all.

### Title: Introducing the Privacy Standards Working Group

*Privacy is becoming the standard. Today, we're making it interoperable.*

---

Today, [NUMBER] leading blockchain organizations announced the formation of the Privacy Standards Working Group (PSWG), an open industry coalition dedicated to developing unified privacy standards for the blockchain ecosystem.

**The Problem: Fragmentation**

Privacy in blockchain is fragmented. Every chain, wallet, and application builds privacy differently:

- Different address formats
- Incompatible encryption schemes
- Varying compliance approaches
- No interoperability

This creates problems for everyone:

- **Developers** waste time rebuilding privacy from scratch
- **Users** face inconsistent experiences across apps
- **Institutions** can't adopt solutions that don't meet compliance needs
- **Regulators** have no standards to reference

**The Solution: Open Standards**

The Privacy Standards Working Group brings together the ecosystem to build standards that work everywhere:

**Founding Members:**
[List with brief descriptions]

**What We're Standardizing:**

1. **Stealth Addresses (SIP-002)**
   Universal format for one-time recipient addresses across all chains.

2. **Viewing Keys (SIP-003)**
   Selective disclosure protocol enabling compliance and auditing.

3. **Cross-Chain Privacy (SIP-300)**
   Interoperable privacy for bridge and multi-chain transactions.

4. **Compliance Frameworks**
   Standards for sanctions screening, audit trails, and Travel Rule.

**Built on SIP**

The Working Group builds on the Shielded Intents Protocol (SIP), which provides:

- Stealth addresses for recipient privacy
- Pedersen commitments for amount hiding
- Viewing keys for selective disclosure
- Support for 15+ blockchain networks

Unlike mixers, SIP is designed for compliance. Transactions are private by default but can be disclosed to authorized parties—enabling privacy that institutions can actually use.

**Open Governance**

The Working Group is member-governed:

- All specifications are CC0 (public domain)
- Reference implementations are MIT licensed
- Steering Committee elected by members
- Open to new participants

**Join Us**

We're building the future of privacy. Whether you're a protocol, wallet, DEX, foundation, or compliance provider, there's a place for you.

- **Full Membership:** Voting rights, early access, subgroup participation
- **Observer Membership:** Open to all interested parties

Privacy shouldn't be a feature. It should be the standard.
