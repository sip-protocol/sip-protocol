Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to invite [Organization] to become a founding member of the
Privacy Standards Working Group, an industry coalition developing interoperable
privacy standards for blockchain.

Why this matters:
• Privacy is becoming essential for institutional adoption
• Fragmented approaches create integration burden
• Regulators need standards they can reference
• Users deserve privacy that works everywhere

Why [Organization]:
[1-2 sentences on their specific relevance and what they bring]

Founding members will:
• Shape the standards that define blockchain privacy
• Ensure their use cases are represented
• Get early access to specifications and implementations
• Be recognized as industry leaders in privacy

We're targeting 15-20 founding members representing privacy protocols,
wallets, DEXs, foundations, and compliance providers.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss?

Best,
[Name]

## Objection Handling

### "We're too busy"

**Response:**
"The time commitment is minimal—quarterly 1-hour meetings plus optional subgroup participation. The value is disproportionate: you shape standards your team would otherwise have to react to."

### "We don't do privacy"

**Response:**
"Privacy is becoming table stakes. Even if you don't build privacy features today, standards will affect your integrations. Being at the table lets you ensure standards work for your architecture."

### "What's in it for us?"

**Response:**
"Three things: (1) Influence over standards that will affect your product, (2) Early access to specifications before public release, (3) Recognition as a privacy leader in the industry."

### "Who else is joining?"

**Response:**
"We're building a coalition across the ecosystem. [Currently committed members]. We're targeting [X] founding members including [categories]."

### "We need to check with legal"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. Here's the charter document and IP policy for their review. The key points: all specs are CC0 (public domain), code is MIT, and there's a RAND-Z patent policy. Happy to jump on a call with your counsel if helpful."

### "We have our own privacy approach"

**Response:**
"That's exactly why we want you involved. The Working Group isn't about picking winners—it's about ensuring interoperability. Your approach can inform the standards while ensuring they work with your implementation."
