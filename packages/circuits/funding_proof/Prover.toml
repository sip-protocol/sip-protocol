# Funding Proof - Example Prover Inputs
#
# These values are computed dynamically in production.
# This file is for testing proof generation only.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. SDK computes commitment = pedersen_commitment([balance, blinding])
# 2. SDK computes commitment_hash = pedersen_hash([commitment.x, commitment.y, asset_id])
# 3. Generate proof with: nargo prove
# 4. Verify proof with: nargo verify

# Public inputs (known to verifier)
commitment_hash = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
minimum_required = 50
asset_id = "0xABCD"

# Private inputs (known only to prover)
balance = 100
blinding = "12345"
